            <h1> Amsterdam Bos</h1>
            <p>The Amsterdamse Bos is a mosaic of wet and dry patches, wooded areas, grassland, reed land and open
                water. Each forest area has its own character and inhabitants. The Amsterdamse Bos is proud to
                present its very own big five!</p>
            <p>The Amsterdamse Bos (English: Amsterdam Forest) is an English park or landscape park in the
                municipalities of Amstelveen and Amsterdam. Although most of the park is located in Amstelveen, the
                owner of the park is the City of Amsterdam. The
                park was mainly built <strong>in the early 1930s</strong>, mostly by the unemployment relief.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because of <em>World War II </em>interrupting the building process, the last tree was not planted
                until the 1970s.[1] Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of 1,000
                hectares (2,500 acres) and is approximately
                three times the size of Central Park in New York City. It houses a number of animal parks, sporting
                clubs, rowing courses, gardens and remembrance monuments.

                Throughout the decades, the location has seen different gatherings, political manifestations and
                (i.a., free) concerts. These often took place on the so-called Vietnam Meadow. Despite extensive
                protests, this part was turned into a tennis
                venue in 1994.

            <h3>Bosbaan</h3>
            <p>
                An important part of the park is the rowing course called de Bosbaan ("Forest course"), which was
                opened in 1937. The course was an alternative for rowing on the Amstel river, or on the canal
                surrounding the polder of the Haarlemmermeer, which
                were the two traditional locations for rowing competition. It is the world's oldest artificial
                rowing course. In 1977 it hosted the World Rowing championships. In order to meet international
                competition regulation, the Bosbaan was widened to
                118 meters (8 lanes for competition and an additional preparation lane). In 2014 the Bosbaan hosted
                the World Rowing Championship for a second time.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Recreational areas</h3>
            <p>
                There are several open areas and meadows within the forest. Some of which are located along an
                artificial beach along ponds and have sanitary, food and children's play facilities for summertime
                recreation. One of the open areas is bordered by a
                man-made hill. The area of the park called Zonneweide is an area designated for naturist recreation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>
                There are several ponds and streams that can be used for swimming. There is a sand beach along a
                part of Grote Vijver pond. Weather conditions permitting, the water in the Groot Kinderbad
                children's paddling pool is activated from May until
                September.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Farms</h3>
            <p>
                Geitenboerderij Riddammerhoeve is a goat farm. Next to offering simple food dishes and making goat
                milk-based dairy products on site, it offers a petting zoo with goats, a playground and a maze.

                Boerderij Meerzicht features a pancake restaurant and deer watching.

            <h3>Open air theatre</h3>
            <p>
                In the open air Amsterdamse Bos Theater paid concerts and plays are held during the Summer period
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Scottish Highlanders</h3>
            <p>
                To combat the forestation in some areas, Scottish Highland cattle have been placed in the park.
                Locked in the area by cattle grids, they make sure the meadow doesn't grow to become a forest while
                remaining a natural look that could not be
                achieved by mowing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Rental facilities</h3>
            <p>
                Canoes, kayaks and bicycles can be rented at several locations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <p>
                At the Day Camping people can put up a tent for a day. For longer stays there is Camping Amsterdamse
                Bos, a campsite that rents out sites for tents, caravans, campervans and has campsite facilities. It
                is not permitted to stay the night and sleep anywhere else in the forest.
                The Amsterdamse Bos has attractions for young and old. From giving the bottle to a goat to relaxing
                in a sauna. On this page you will find what the Bos has to offer you</p>
