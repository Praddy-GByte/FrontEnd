        <h2>About me </h2>
        <p>I am a Software Engineering and Business Operation Specialist with expertise in GIS (Geographic Information
            System). Additionally, I am a GIS Specialist, Author, Researcher, and experienced Python programmer. My
            skill set encompasses a wide range of domains, including geology, geomorphology, remote sensing, and GIS
            programming. With my in-depth knowledge and proficiency in SQL and FME (Feature Manipulation Engine), I have
            successfully implemented GIS solutions and conducted research in the field. I am passionate about leveraging
            GIS technology to analyze spatial data, develop efficient workflows, and provide valuable insights for
            various industries. As an avid speaker, I actively engage in talks and discussions related to GIS and its
            applications. Through my writing, I strive to share my expertise and contribute to the GIS community.</p>
